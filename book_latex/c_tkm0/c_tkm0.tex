\beginchapterquote{``\ldots{} We must guard against a fallacy common apologists of
                     science, the fallacy of supposing that the men whose work benefits
                     humanity are thinking much of that while they do it
                     \ldots{} There are many highly respectable motives that may lead
                     men to prosecute research, but there are three which are much more
                     important than the rest.  The first (without which the rest must
                     come to nothing) is intellectual curiosity, desire to know the
                     truth.  Then, professional pride, anxiety to be satisfied with
                     one's performance, the shame that overcomes any self-respecting
                     craftsman when his work is unworthy of his talent.  Finally,
                     ambition, desire for reputation, and the position, even the
                     power or the money, which it brings.''}
