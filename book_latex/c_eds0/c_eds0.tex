The relationships between the four codewords of this code can be
depicted as in Figure \ref{fig:ceds0:exe01:01}.  For example,
the Hamming distance between 0001 and 1010 is 3, and the
Hamming distance between 0110 and 1010 is 2.

Since the minimum Hamming distance $\hat{d}$ is defined as the minimum
Hamming distance between any two codewords, this distance is 2.
